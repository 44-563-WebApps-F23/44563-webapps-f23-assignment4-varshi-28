    <h2>Name of the Play: GHOSTS</h2>
    <h2>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h2>

    <p><h3>MRS. ALVING</h3><span class="direction">[Laying her two hands upon his shoulders.]</span> And I say that I
        have half a mind to put my arms round your neck, and kiss you.</p><br>
    <p><h3>MANDERS</h3><span class="direction">[Stepping hastily back.]</span> No, no! God bless me! What an idea!</p><br>
    <p><h3>MRS. ALVING</h3><span class="direction">[With a smile.]</span> Oh, you needn't be afraid of me.</p><br>
    <p><h3>MANDERS</h3><span class="direction">[By the table.]</span> You have sometimes such an exaggerated way of
        expressing yourself. Now, let me just collect all the documents, and put
        them in my bag. [He does so.] There, that's all right. And now, good-bye
        for the present. Keep your eyes open when Oswald comes back. I shall
        look in again later.<span class="direction">[He takes his hat and goes out through the hall
            door.]</span></p><br>
    <p><h3>MRS. ALVING</h3><span class="direction">[Sighs, looks for a moment out of the window, sets the room
        in order a little, and is about to go into the dining-room, but stops at
        the door with a half-suppressed cry.]</span> Oswald, are you still at table?</p><br>
    <p><h3>OSWALD</h3><span class="direction">[In the dining room.]</span> I'm only finishing my cigar.</p><br>
    <p><h3>MRS. ALVING</h3> I thought you had gone for a little walk.</p><br>
