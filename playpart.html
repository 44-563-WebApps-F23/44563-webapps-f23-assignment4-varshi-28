    <p class="direction ">[Laying her two hands upon his shoulders.]</p>
    <p class="speech" >And I say that I
        have half a mind to put my arms round your neck, and kiss you.</p>

<p class="character-Manders">MANDERS.</b></p>
    <p class="direction ">[Stepping hastily back.]</p>
    <p class="speech" > No, no! God bless me! What an idea!</p>

<p class="character-MrsAlving">MRS. ALVING.<br></p>
        <p class="direction ">[With a smile.]</p>

        <p class="speech" >  You have sometimes such an exaggerated way of
            expressing yourself. Now, let me just collect all the documents, and put
            them in my bag. 
        <p class="direction">[He does so.]</p>
        <p class="speech">There, that's all right. And now, good-bye
            for the present. Keep your eyes open when Oswald comes back. I shall
            look in again later.</p>
        <p class="direction">[He takes his hat and goes out through the hall
                door.]</p>

        <p class="direction">[Sighs, looks for a moment out of the window, sets the room
                        in order a little, and is about to go into the dining-room, but stops at
                        the door with a half-suppressed cry.]</p>
        <p class="speech"> Oswald, are you still at table?</p>
    
<p class="character-Oswald">OSWALD.<br></p>
