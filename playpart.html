    <p> <b>MRS. ALVING.</b><h5>[Laying her two hands upon his shoulders.]</h5>And I say that I
        have half a mind to put my arms round your neck, and kiss you. </p><br>
        <p><b>MANDERS. </b>
            <h5>[Stepping hastily back.] </h5> No, no! God bless me! What an idea!</p><br>
        <p><b>MRS. ALVING.</b>
            <h5>[With a smile.]</h5>
            Oh, you needn't be afraid of me.</p><br>
        <p><b>MANDERS.</b>
            <h5>[By the table.]</h5>
            You have sometimes such an exaggerated way of
        expressing yourself. Now, let me just collect all the documents, and put
        them in my bag. [He does so.] There, that's all right. And now, good-bye
        for the present. Keep your eyes open when Oswald comes back. I shall
        look in again later.
        <h5>[He takes his hat and goes out through the hall
            door.]</h5></p><br>
        <p><b>MRS. ALVING.</b>
            <h5>[Sighs, looks for a moment out of the window, sets the room
        in order a little, and is about to go into the dining-room, but stops at
        the door with a half-suppressed cry.]</h5>
        Oswald, are you still at table?</p><br>
            <p><b>OSWALD.</b>
            <h5>[In the dining room.]</h5>I'm only finishing my cigar.</p><br>
        <p><b>MRS. ALVING.</b>
        I thought you had gone for a little walk.</p><br>
