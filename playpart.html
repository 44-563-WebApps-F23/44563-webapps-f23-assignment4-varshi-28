    <p class="speech" >And I say that I
        have half a mind to put my arms round your neck, and kiss you.</p>

    <p class="direction ">[Stepping hastily back.]</p>
    <p class="speech" > No, no! God bless me! What an idea!</p>

<p class="character-MrsAlving">MRS. ALVING.<br>
        <p class="direction ">[With a smile.]</p>

        <p class="speech" >  You have sometimes such an exaggerated way of
            expressing yourself. Now, let me just collect all the documents, and put

        <p class="speech">There, that's all right. And now, good-bye
            for the present. Keep your eyes open when Oswald comes back. I shall
            look in again later.</p>

        <p class="direction">[Sighs, looks for a moment out of the window, sets the room
                        in order a little, and is about to go into the dining-room, but stops at
                        the door with a half-suppressed cry.]</p>
        <p class="speech"> Oswald, are you still at table?</p>
